# Bel Formatted

This is an unofficial, formatted website version of [Paul Grahamâ€™s guide and source code for his Bel programming language](http://paulgraham.com/bel.html). Since the source code and guide are meant to be read in parallel, I put them side by side, which makes it easier for me to read.

The markdown versions of the files are from <https://github.com/alephyud/bel>.

To build `index.html`, run `bundle install`, then `bundle exec ruby main.rb`.
